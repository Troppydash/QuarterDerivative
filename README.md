# Quarter Derivatives

## A collection of algorithms, theorems, and projects

Feel free to download and run the files if you are interested.

### Structure
The project structure is pretty messy at the moment:
- `experiements` contains testing code that confirms a theory
- `leetcode` are my leetcode solutions
- `qd-symbdiff` is a wacky symbolic differentiation library
- `studies` contains the LaTeX explainations of some algorithms
- `theory` contains the proper theoretical models, algorithms, and such


### Notable Studies
- `experiments/grel`: a metric tensor and general relativity model
- `experiments/halfrange`: testing the halfrange vs sample SD error models
- `qd-symbdiff`: symbolic differentiation
- `theory/convolution`: convolution fft, and PDFs of random variables using convolutions
- `theory/neuralnetwork`: classical backpropagated feed-forward neural network
- `theory/gquad`: Gaussian Quad implementation and explanations
- `theory/padic`: P-Adic numbers library
- `theory/sinc`: the exploration of borwein integrals and a summary of integration techniques
