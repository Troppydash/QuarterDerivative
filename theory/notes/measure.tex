\section{Sigma Algebra}
A measure is the generalized volume or length of a subset. For instance, measure on the real line provides a generalized notion of length for subsets of the real numbers. The normal length measure of a closed interval on the real line $[a, b]$ is $b-a$.

We will consider a abstract measure theory. For a set $X$, let the set of its subsets (powerset) be denoted as $P(X)$.

\begin{defi}[Measurable subsets]
    For a set $X$, let set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq P(X)$ contain some subsets of $X$. The set $\mathcal A$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if it fulfills
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The empty and whole set must be in $\mathcal A$, where $\{\}, X \in \mathcal A$.
        \item The set complement of any set in $\mathcal A$ must also be in $\mathcal A$, where
        \[
            A \in \mathcal A \implies A^c = X \setminus A \in \mathcal A
        \]
        \item The union of a countably sized number of sets in $\mathcal A$ is also in $\mathcal A$, where for a countable selection of $A_i$
        \[
            i \in \mathbb{N}, A_i \in \mathcal A \implies \bigcup_{i = 0}^{\infty} A_i \in \mathcal A
        \]
    \end{enumerate}

    For such a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal A$ on the set $X$, the subsets of $X$ contained in $\mathcal A$ (or just members of the $\sigma$-algebra) are called measurable subsets.
\end{defi}

Measurable sets are closed in the $\sigma$-algebra under complements and countable unions.

Some examples of $\sigma$-algebras on the set $X$ are
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal A = \{ \emptyset, X\}$, this is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra
    \item $\mathcal A = P(X)$, this is the largest $\sigma$-algebra
\end{itemize}

\section{Borel Sigma Algebras}
\begin{theorem}[Intersection of $\sigma$-algebras]
    For an arbitrary amount of sigma algebras $i \in I, \mathcal A_i$ on $X$, the intersection of them is also a sigma algebra on $X$,
    \[
        \bigcap_{i \in I} \mathcal A_i
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Consider the sigma algebras $\mathcal A_i$ on $X$ and their intersections $\mathcal B = \bigcap \mathcal A_i$, we need to show that $\mathcal B$ is also a sigma algebra.

    For 1, note that because both the empty set and full set are in all sigma algebras, then they are also in $\mathcal B$
    \begin{align*}
        \forall i \in I, \emptyset, X \in \mathcal A_i \implies \emptyset, X \in \mathcal B
    \end{align*}

    For 2, if a set $B \in \mathcal{B}$, then $B$ is in all sigma algebras as well as $B^c$, so $B^c$ is in $\mathcal{B}$
    \[
        B \in \mathcal{B} \implies \forall i \in I, B \in \mathcal{A}_i \implies B^c \in \mathcal{A}_i \implies B^c \in \mathcal{B}
    \]

    For 3, for some countable number of elements $B_k \in \mathcal B$, each is also in all sigma algebras $B_k \in \mathcal A_i$, hence the union of $B_k$ is in all sigma algebras, and thus also in $\mathcal B$
    \[
        k \in \mathbb{N}, B_k \in \mathcal B \implies \forall i \in I, B_k \in \mathcal A_i \implies \forall i \in I, \bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty} B_k \in \mathcal A_i \implies \bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty} B_k \in \mathcal B
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}[Smallest $\sigma$-algebra]
    For any set $M \in P(X)$ that is a set of subsets in $X$, the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains the elements of $M$ is the intersection of all $\sigma$-algebra that contains the elements of $M$.
    \[
        M \subseteq \bigcap_{M \subseteq \mathcal A} \mathcal A = \sigma(M)
    \]
    and $\mathcal A$ are all $\sigma$-algebras.

    The smallest $\sigma$-algebra of $M$ is denoted by $\sigma(M)$, or called the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $M$.
\end{defi}

To practically construct the smallest $\sigma$-algebra of a set $M$, we progressively apply the definitions of $\sigma$-algebras and append new subsets into the set.

\begin{defi}[Borel Sigma Algebra]
    For the set $X$ which is a metric space (consists of a set and a metric, like $\mathbb{R}^n$ and Euclidean distance), we define the Borel Sigma algebra to be the sigma algebra generated by all the open sets in $X$.

    An open set $S$ in $X$ is a subset where for every element $s$ in $S$, there exists a distance $\epsilon > 0$ such that $\forall x, d(x, s) < \epsilon \implies x \in S$. That is, for each element in $S$ there exists a small disc around which is also contained in $S$.

    The Borel Sigma algebra is in essence
    \[
        B(X) = \sigma(M)
    \]
    where $M$ contains all the open sets in $X$.
\end{defi}

The Borel $\sigma$-algebra on space $X$ is importantly not the power set of the space, $P(X)$. We require such structure to define a measure function with appropriate features.

\section{Measure}

\begin{defi}[Measurable Space]
    A measurable space consists of an ordered-tuple $(X, \mathcal A)$ where $X$ is a set and $\mathcal A$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on the set $X$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Measure]
    For a measurable space $(X, \mathcal A)$, a mapping $\mu$ from the $\sigma$-algebra to the zero and positive real numbers $\mu \colon \mathcal A \to [0, \infty]$ is called a measure if it satisfies:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For the empty set $\emptyset \in \mathcal A$ from the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal A$, its volume/measure should be zero
        \[
            \mu(\emptyset) = 0
        \]
        \item The $\sigma$-additive rule. For any countable number of mutually disjointed measurable sets in our sigma algebra, the volume of their union is the sum of their individual volumes. So given
        \[
            i \in \mathbb{N}, A_i \in \mathcal A, i \neq j \implies A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset
        \]
        then we have
        \[
            \mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_i)
        \]
        Note that the union of the measurable sets has a measure because of their closure under the $\sigma$-algebra.
    \end{enumerate}

    The co-domain of the measure includes both the positive reals and a symbol infinity, \\ where $[0, \infty] = [0, \infty) \cup  \{\infty\}$. This space has some special rules:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\forall x \in [0, \infty], x + \infty = \infty$
        \item $\forall x \in (0, \infty], x \times \infty = \infty$
        \item $0 \times \infty = 0$ for some cases only in measure theory.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}


\begin{defi}[Measure Space]
    A measure space is a ordered set $(X, \mathcal A, \mu)$ where $X$ is a set, $\mathcal A$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$, and $\mu$ is a measure on the measurable space.
\end{defi}

\subsection{Examples of Measures}
The following measures works on all sets $X$ and any of their their $\sigma$-algebras $\mathcal A$.

The counting measure is defined by the mapping
\[
    \mu(A) = \begin{cases}
        |A| & \text{$A$ is finite sized}\\
        \infty & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
where $A \in \mathcal A$ is a member of the $\sigma$-algebra. The measure axioms for the finite cases is obvious to show. The counting measure maps subsets to their sizes as generalized volumes.

The Dirac measure on a point $p \in X$ maps subsets containing $p$ to $1$ and subsets not containing it to $0$, it is defined by
\[
    \delta_p(A) = \begin{cases}
        1 & p \in A\\
        0 & p \notin A
    \end{cases}
\]

To search for a measure that generalizes volume in Euclidean space $X = \mathbb{R}^n$, we require that our measure adhere to some basis axioms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The measure of a unit volume/cube (set of points from $[0,1]$ in all dimensions) is always $1$
    \[
        \mu([0,1]^n) = 1
    \]
    \item The measure is invariant under translation by a vector
    \[
        \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n, \forall A \in \mathcal A, \mu(x + A) = \mu(A)
    \]
\end{enumerate}
One measure that works is the Lebesgue measure, but it only works on $\sigma$-algebras that are not simply the powerset --- it operates on the Borel $\sigma$-algebras on a metric space.

\section{Lebesgue Measures On the Real Powerset Proof}

\begin{defi}[Equivalence class]
    An equivalence class within the set $X$ defined by the equivalence relation $x \sim y$ on $a \in X$ is
    \[
        [a] = \{x \in X \colon x \sim a\} \subseteq X
    \]
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Axiom of Choice]
    For an indexed set of subsets (of set $X$), $i \in I, S_i \subseteq X$, there exists a set $A$ containing a single element from each set
    \[
        i \in I, a_i = f(S_i), A = \{a_0, a_1, \dots\}
    \]
    where $f \colon P(X) \to X$ is a choice function on the subsets $S_i$.
\end{defi}

\begin{theorem}[Monotonic Measures]
    Consider a measure $\mu$ on a measurable space $(X, \mathcal A)$. If for some $A, B \in \mathcal A$, $A \subseteq B$, then
    \[
        \mu(A) \leq \mu(B)
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For the given sets $A, B \in \mathcal A$ with $A \subseteq B$, let $C = B \setminus A$ so that $A \cup C = B$. Then
    \[
        \mu(B) = \mu(A \cup C) = \mu(A) + \mu(C) \geq \mu(A)
    \]
    for $\mu(C) \geq 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Powerset Zero Measure]
    For all measures $\mu$ on the measurable space $(\mathbb{R}, P(\mathbb{R}))$ that satisfies
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mu((0,1]) < \infty$
        \item $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, A \in P(\mathbb{R}), \mu(x + A) = \mu(A)$
    \end{enumerate}
    the measure must be the zero measure
    \[
        \forall A \in P(\mathbb{R}), \mu(A) = 0
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Within the interval $I = (0,1]$, consider the equivalence relation defined by
    \[
        \forall x, y \in I, x \sim y \iff x - y \in \mathbb{Q}
    \]

    We can partition the interval $I$ with some infinite equivalence relations that may or may not be countable
    \[
        I = \bigcup_{i} [a_i], a_i \in I
    \]
    and notice that each equivalence class is disjoint with all others.

    Using the Axioms of Choice, we create a set $A$ by picking one unique element from each equivalence class
    \[
        A = \{a_0, a_1, \dots\} \subseteq I
    \]
    namely, the set $A$ has the property that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For any equivalence class, there is an element in $A$ that is in that class.
        \[
        \forall [a_i], \exists a \in A, a \in [a_i]
        \]
        \item That the element in (1) is unique in $A$.
        \[
            \forall [a_i], \forall a, b \in A, a,b \in [a_i] \implies a = b
        \]
    \end{enumerate}


    Consider the enumerated rational translations of such set $A$, where $r_n, n \in \mathbb{N}$ is an enumeration of rational numbers within $(-1, 1]$
    \[
        A_n = A + r_n
    \]
    We note that these translated sets are disjoint, namely
    \[
        n \neq m \implies A_n \cap A_m = \emptyset
    \]
    this can be proved by contraposition
    \begin{align*}
        A_n \cap A_m \neq \emptyset &\implies \exists x, x \in A_n \land x \in A_m\\
        &\implies \exists a_n, a_m \in A, x = r_n + a_n = r_m + a_m\\
        &\implies a_n - a_m = r_m - r_n \in \mathbb{Q}\\
        &\implies a_n \sim a_m\\
        &\implies a_n = a_m\\
        &\implies r_m = r_n \implies n = m
    \end{align*}

    Then notice that both
    \[
        (0, 1] \subseteq \bigcup_n A_n \subseteq (-1, 2]
    \]
    as
    \begin{align*}
        x \in (0, 1] &\implies \exists a \in A, a \in [x]\\ &\implies \exists r \in \mathbb{Q}, a + r = x\\
        &\implies \exists n, r_n = r, x \in A_n\\
        &\implies x \in \bigcup_n A_n\\
        x \in \bigcup_n A_n &\implies \exists n, x \in A_n\\
        &\implies x \in r_n + A\\
        r_n \in (-1, 1], A \subseteq (0, 1] &\implies -1 < x \leq 2\\
        &\implies x \in (-1, 2]
    \end{align*}


    Because measures are monotonic,
    \[
        \mu((0, 1]) \leq \mu(\bigcup_n A_n) \leq \mu((-1, 2])
    \]
    Suppose that $\mu((0, 1]) = c < \infty$
    \[
        \mu((-1, 2]) = \mu((-1, 0] \cup (0, 1] \cup (1, 2]) = 3c
    \]
    Then because $\mu(A_n) = \mu(r_n + A) = \mu(A)$ we have
    \[
        c \leq \sum_n \mu(A) \leq 3c
    \]
    As $c$ is finite, the middle summation must also be finite. For $n$ is countably infinite, the only way this identity holds is if $\mu(A) = 0$ as anything else results in infinity.

    Hence $c = 0$, with
    \[
        \mu(\mathbb{R}) = \mu(\bigcup_{z \in \mathbb{Z}} (0, 1] + z ) = \sum_z \mu((0, 1]) = 0
    \]
    As any subset of $\mathbb{R}$ must also have zero measure (otherwise the measure for $\mathbb{R}$ is non-zero)
    \[
        \forall A \in P(\mathbb{R}) \implies A \subseteq \mathbb{R} \implies \mu(A) = 0
    \]

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Non Lebesgue Measures]
    For the measurable space $(X, P(X))$ where the set is the real number line, $X = \mathbb{R}$, there does not exist a Lebesgue measure --- a measure that follows geometric intuition $\mu \colon P(X) \to [0,\infty]$ where
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mu([0,1]) = 1$
        \item $\forall x \in X, A \in P(X), \mu(x+A) = \mu(A)$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By the previous lemma, if such measure $\mu$ exists,
    \[
        1 = \mu([0,1]) = \mu(\{0\} \cup (0, 1]) \implies \mu((0, 1]) = 1 - \mu(\{0\}) < \infty
    \]
    Therefore $\mu = 0$, which is a contradiction to the fact that $\mu([0, 1]) = 1 \neq 0$. Hence a measure $\mu$ can't exist.
\end{proof}

\newpage
\section{Measurable Maps}
\begin{defi}[Measurable Maps]
    Given two measurable spaces $(\Omega_1, \mathcal A_1)$ and $(\Omega_2, \mathcal A_2)$, a mapping $f \colon \Omega_1 \to \Omega_2$ is a measurable map when the pre-image of measurable sets are also measurable sets
    \[
        \forall A \in \mathcal A_2, f^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal A_1
    \]
\end{defi}

This definition of measurable maps is important in defining an integral of a function $f$. If the function is measurable, then the pre-image of any measurable set of its range is also measurable on its domain, so we can take the measure of the pre-image and multiply it against the height (summing for every height) to compute the integral.

\begin{theorem}[Composition of Measurable Mappings]
    For the measurable spaces $(\Omega_1, \mathcal A_1), (\Omega_2, \mathcal A_2), (\Omega_3, \mathcal A_3)$ and the mappings $f \colon \Omega_1 \to \Omega_2$ and $g \colon \Omega_2 \to \Omega_3$. If both $f$ and $g$ are measurable with respect to the $\sigma$-algebras, then their composition $g \circ f \colon \Omega_1 \to \Omega_3$ is also measurable with the same $\sigma$-algebras.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Consider the measurable set $S \in \mathcal A_3$. Using the identity of pre-images
    \[
        (g \circ f)^{-1}(S) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(S))
    \]

    As $g$ is measurable, $g^{-1}(S) \in \mathcal A_2$ is also a measurable set; As $f$ is measurable, $f^{-1}(g^{-1}(S)) \in \mathcal A_1$ is also a measurable set. Hence the pre-image of $S$ is a measurable set and the composition is also measurable.
\end{proof}



\subsection{Examples of Measurable Maps}
Consider the measurable spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal A)$ and $(\mathbb{R}, B(\mathbb{R}))$, the characteristic map on set $A \subseteq \Omega$ is defined to be
\[
    \chi_A(x) = \begin{cases}
        1 & x \in A\\
        0 & x \not\in A
    \end{cases}
\]

The characteristic map is measurable when $A$ is measurable $A \in \mathcal A$, for let $B = B(\mathbb{R})$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item if $B$ contains neither $0$ or $1$, then its pre-image is the empty set, which is in $\mathcal A$
    \item if $B$ contains only $0$ or $1$, then its pre-image is either $A$ or $A^c$, which are both in $\mathcal A$
    \item if $B$ contains both $0$ and $1$, then its pre-image is $\Omega$ which is in $\mathcal A$
\end{enumerate}
The map is measurable because all pre-images of measurable sets in the co-domain is also a measurable set in the domain with respect to $\mathcal A$.

\begin{theorem}[Measurable Real Number Functions]
    For the measurable spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal A)$ and $(\mathbb{R}, B(\mathbb{R}))$. If the functions $f,g \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ are both measurable, then
    \[
        f+g, f-g, f \cdot g, |f|
    \]
    are all measurable functions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This proof depends on the properties of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on the real numbers, which is really difficult. Take this theorem as given please.
\end{proof}

Continuous functions in the real numbers are always measurable.
